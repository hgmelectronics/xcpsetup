Qt 5.5 has an error that prevents running static QML applications that use FileDialog,
and probably also ColorDialog, FontDialog, and MessageDialog. The QML source files for
these classes have a statement 'import "qml"', which works when the files are in the
regular filesystem (as with a dynamic build deployed with windeployqt.exe) but not when
they are compiled into a library for single-executable static build.

To fix this, before compiling Qt, copy dialogs.diff to
$QT_SOURCE_BASE/qtquickcontrols/src/dialogs and patch:

patch -p1 < dialogs.diff

Also, copy the contents of the directory 'qml' up to its parent, 'dialogs'. This should be:

ColorSlider.qml
DefaultWindowDecoration.qml
IconButtonStyle.qml
IconGlyph.qml
qmldir
icons.ttf
